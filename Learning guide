What To Do When Youâ€™re Stuck
You will inevitably get stuck at some point in the curriculum, perhaps due to a concept that you are having difficulty understanding or perhaps due to something not working correctly in a project. Whatever it is, use the following tools to get unstuck:

Google it: You can be certain someone else out there has encountered the same problem as you at some point. A quick Google search can often lead to a solution.
Take a break: Allow your diffuse learning state to work on the problem.
Ask for help in our chat: Come prepared with your research. People will be more willing to help you when they can see you have already put effort into trying to figure out the solution on your own.
Managing Your Study Time
You will have more success with Odin by putting consistent time into it rather than working on it once a week. Building a habit of studying every day at a specific time and with a specific goal will ensure that you make consistent progress.
